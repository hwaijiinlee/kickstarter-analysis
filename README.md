## Overview of Project
Louise saw success in her fundraising efforts for the play Fever and is keen to understand how other campaigns fared.
### Purpose
This analysis is performed to investigate the outcomes of theater-related campaigns based on their launch dates as well as how campaigns for plays fare based on their fundraising goals.
## Analysis and Challenges
